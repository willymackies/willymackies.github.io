  <h2><span id="title">INTRODUCTION</span></h2>
    <p>I am Malaysian/Australian, born and raised in Malaysia and arrived in Australia late 2018. My main spoken language is Cantonese, second would be Mandarin and last would be English. I do multiple sports of interest such as Badminton, Futsal, Mountain biking, long distance running, but not as often as I would love to due to work and studies at the moment.</p>

    <div class="first-para">
    <h2><span class="it">Interest in IT (Information Technology)</span></h2>
    <p>I’ve always been fascinated with technology in general since I had my first Personal Computer when I was just 14, and not just how they operate but the people working behind it, how they create something so advance using complex coding and the countless hours required to make it.</p>
    <p>I would say that I feel in love with technology after I had my first laptop, I felt like I was in the matrix, with infinite amount of information, games, convenience of doing my essay and school work with all the tools I’ll ever need.</p>
    <p>Why did I choose RMIT? To be honest, when I saw the word, Royal Melbourne of Institution of Technology, it just caught my attention and I had friends studying there too, haha. But I did my research and RMIT is best known in Melbourne for the course that I’m interest in, which is Computer Science. I have no experience in IT whatsoever but I’m always ready to learn new things every day.</p>
    <p>Hopefully, I’ll be able to understand and apply basic knowledge from what I’ve learn in this course into my daily life and further my studies into a specialist of one or more fields in Computer Science.</p>

    <p>A Web Developer or Programmer is someone who build websites, create apps, or/and writing a software program for multiple tasks, it’s what we use in our daily life and I find that really intrigue because we usually don’t ask the question ‘How was it created?’, ‘How is it possible for something so small to store that much data and information with just a click/press of a button?’. I’m more interesting in experiencing it then just hearing from it online.</p>
    <p>Setting up a program requires at least the knowledge of one software language and the rest would follow the same principle but with different words. You would need to understand the fundamentals of the languages of how it operates and a lot of time and effort before you can actually build a fully functioning website, but they are some open-source codes online you can copy or learn how it works.</p>
    <p>Currently I’ve just started learning Programming and learning my first language, which is phyton, with zero knowledge and experience whatsoever, and I love it! Sometimes learning something new that interest you is really all you need in life.</p>
    <p>Doing an Online course at RMIT about IT is just a stepping stone for me to build up that foundation needed for in-depth Knowledge about being a Programmer with a qualification for that specific role that I’m currently interested in and I’m glad that I finally took my first step into reaching that goal!</p>

  <h2> IT PROJECT – immersive VR interaction </h2>
 <h2> Overview </h2>
Immersive VR (virtual reality) interaction refers to the use of VR technology to create a fully immersive experience for the user. This can include the use of VR headsets, gloves, or other devices that allow the user to interact with a virtual environment as if they were physically present in it. VR technology has the ability to simulate a wide range of experiences, from realistic simulations of real-world environments to completely fantastical virtual worlds.
<h2> Motivation </h2>
At a young age, I was interested in video games. I believe that they not only provide entertainment but can also be a way to learn and acquire knowledge that can be applied in our daily lives, especially when interacting with people from different backgrounds online. Through playing video games, I have learned skills such as social interaction, how to communicate with people who have different accents and cultural backgrounds, and basic knowledge about different countries. I have even learned how to build my PC through building PC simulator games. In addition to these practical skills, I believe that video games can also teach creativity and social decision-making.
immersive VR interaction could also be useful in a variety of other fields in the future, including:

- Therapy and rehabilitation: VR technology could be used to help patients recover from injuries or conditions by providing a safe and controlled environment in which they can perform therapeutic exercises.

- Tourism: VR technology could be used to allow people to virtually visit and explore places around the world, without the need for physical travel.

- Virtual meetings and events: VR technology could be used to facilitate virtual meetings and events, allowing people to attend and participate in them from anywhere in the world.

- Remote work: VR technology could be used to allow people to work remotely, with the ability to feel as if they are in the same physical location as their colleagues.

Overall, the future potential for immersive VR interaction is vast, and it is likely to have a significant impact in a variety of fields in the coming years.
<h2> Description </h2>
Immersive VR (virtual reality) interaction refers to the use of VR technology to create a fully immersive experience for the user. This typically involves the use of a VR headset, which is a device that is worn on the head and covers the eyes, providing a visual display of the virtual environment. Some VR headsets also include headphones for audio immersion and may include additional sensors or controllers for tracking the user's movements and allowing them to interact with the virtual environment.

When using immersive VR, the user is typically able to look around and move within the virtual environment as if they were physically present in it. This can be accomplished through the use of sensors and controllers that track the user's head and body movements, allowing them to "move" within the virtual space. Depending on the specific VR headset and software being used, the user may also be able to interact with virtual objects and environments using gestures, voice commands, or physical controllers.

One of the main benefits of immersive VR interaction is the sense of presence it can provide. Because the user is fully immersed in the virtual environment, they can feel as if they are actually present in it. This can be especially useful in educational and training scenarios, where VR technology can be used to create simulations of real-world environments that allow users to learn and practice new skills without the risks associated with real-world training.

There are many different types of VR headsets and other devices available for immersive VR interaction, each with its own unique features and capabilities. Some of the most common types of VR headsets include:

- PC-based VR systems: These VR systems require a PC or other high-powered computer to run, and typically include a headset with sensors and controllers, as well as a separate set of cameras or other sensors that are placed around the room to track the user's movements.

- Standalone VR systems: These VR systems are self-contained and do not require a separate computer or other device to run. They often have built-in sensors and controllers, and may include features such as high-resolution displays, positional audio, and haptic feedback.

- Mobile VR systems: These VR systems use a smartphone or other mobile device as the display and processing unit, and typically include a headset with sensors and controllers that allow the user to interact with the virtual environment.

In addition to its educational and training applications, immersive VR interaction also has the potential to be used for entertainment purposes. As VR technology continues to improve, it is likely that users will be able to experience increasingly realistic and immersive virtual environments and activities. This could include everything from virtual roller coasters and sports simulations to virtual concerts and other live events.
